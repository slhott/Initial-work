               Frances Allen



Francis Allen is 84 years old.  She began her career in the mid-1950's as a Math Teacher, but got sidetracked into computers in an attempt to pay off her student loans. 

 From 1966 on, Ms. Allen produced research papers dealing with flow analysis and program optimization.   Frances Allen worked in the 1970's with research partner, John Cocke, developing analysis strategies for optimizing compilers.
 
 Compilers are computer programs that take source codes from a source program and transform them into another, target, computer language. This process is usually done in order to produce an executable program.  Fran Allen worked to optimize compilers.  Optimizing, in this regard, means to minimize or maximize and effect.  Effects could be, for example, the program's energy use, the time it takes for the execution to take place, or the amount of computer memory the operation takes up.
 
 Francis Allen has worked with the United States intelligence agencies on security codes and programming languages.  
 Her awards are many, including the prestigious Turing Award.  She was the first woman to receive the award.  She was also the first woman to be an IBM Fellow.
